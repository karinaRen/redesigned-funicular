# Thesis

Scientific computing has been very effective for society right now. It is more accurate and it is considered a faster way when trying to solve a complex problem that may be dificult to solve in the "traditional" way. In my opinion, scientific computing is exceptional when trying to efficiently and promptly solve a problelm for a class, one that may be more colpewx and take more time to solve in the way taught in class. Scientific computing can assist students develop analytical thinking skills, because it causes students to think critically about what they are asking the computer to do, in order to get the right answer in the end.

I will prove my point and support my thesis with a problem from my chemistry class, which involves trying to find the number of neutrons of the first 18 elements given its atomic masses anda tomic numbers. I will use various methods in order to support my thesis, which involve creating a table for my data, a graph in order to display my data, and in addition I will create an equatiion in order to show how important and useful scientific computing is overall.    

# Goal 
- The goal of this final project is to be able to effectively create a couple of tables with some information about the first 18 elements from the periodic table, a graph to display the relationship between the atomic mass and the number of neutrons, and an equation as an additional way to explain the relationship bettween the elements' number of neutrons and atomic masses. All of these aspects will help support my thesis, that scientifi ccomputing is very helpful anf effective when having to use it to solve a certain problem   
 
# Evidence
In order to suppport my thesis, I will solve my probelm using python in many different ways.
1. First we need to import what will be needed in this project: numpy, sympy, matplotlib, and pandas
```{python}
import numpy as np
import sympy
import matplotlib as plt
import pandas as pd
```
- All of these things will help me and facilitate the process when trying to calculatie the average mass of a chemical formula ( examples will be shown later on)  

- Afterwards, I will create some tables in order to be able to make the calculations needed,

``` {python}
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os


element = np.array([
	"Hydrogen", "Helium", "Lithium", "Beryllium", "Boron", "Carbon", "Nitrogen", "Oxygen", "Fluorine", "Neon", "Sodium", "Magnesium", "Aluminum", "Silicon", "Phosphorus", "Sulfur", "Chlorine", "Argon"
])

symbols = np.array([
	"H", "He", "Li", "Be", "B", "C", "N", "O", "F", "Ne", "Na", "Mg", "Al", "Si", "P", "S", "Cl", "Ar"
])

atomic_numbers = np.array([
	"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13", "14", "15", "16", "17", "18"
],dtype=float)

atomic_numbers = np.arange (1,19)


atomic_masses = np.array([ 
	"1.008", "4.0026", "6.94", "9.0122", "10.81", "12.011", "14.007", "15.99", "18.998", "20.180", "22.990", "24.305", "26.982", "28.085", "30.974", "32.06", "35.45", "39.948"
], dtype=float) 

atomic_masses = atomic_masses.astype(float)

number_of_neutrons = np.subtract(atomic_masses, atomic_numbers)

neutrons_int = number_of_neutrons.astype(int)

print(number_of_neutrons)

df = pd.DataFrame({
	"Element": element, 
	"Atomic Number": atomic_numbers,	
	"Atomic Mass": atomic_masses,
	"Neutrons": neutrons_int
})

print(df.to_markdown(index=False))

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))

plt.scatter(atomic_numbers, neutrons_int)

plt.title("Atomic Mass vs. Number of Neutrons")
plt.xlabel("Atomic Mass")
plt.ylabel("Number of Neutrons")
plt.savefig("index.png")
os.system("open index.png")


# Fit the model
x = atomic_numbers.reshape(-1, 1)
y = atomic_masses
model = LinearRegression().fit(x, y)

# Save slope and intercept
m = model.coef_[0]
b = model.intercept_

# Display numeric results
m,b
```
$$
y = 1.24x - 1
$$
